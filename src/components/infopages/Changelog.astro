            Fixed a bug that caused the account summary page to crash when
            displaying large amounts of data. This issue was primarily affecting
            users with a high number of transactions and multiple accounts. Our
            team was able to identify the cause of the problem and implement a
            fix to ensure a smooth and stable experience for all users.

            Improved the load times of the transaction history page by
            optimizing database queries. We received feedback from users that
            the page was taking longer than expected to load, especially for
            those with a large number of transactions. Our developers worked to
            optimize the database queries and reduce the amount of data being
            pulled, resulting in faster load times for the transaction history
            page.

            Added a new feature that allows users to set up recurring payments
            for bills and subscriptions directly from their account. This
            feature allows users to schedule recurring payments for bills such
            as rent, utilities, and subscriptions, so they never miss a payment
            again. They can also view and manage all their scheduled payments in
            one place. This feature is available for both credit and debit
            accounts.

            Updated the design of the account settings page for a more intuitive
            user experience. We received feedback that the previous design of
            the account settings page was confusing and difficult to navigate.
            Our design team worked to simplify the layout and improve the
            overall user experience. The new design is more streamlined and
            makes it easier for users to find and manage their account settings.
